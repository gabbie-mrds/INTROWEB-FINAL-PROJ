                        <p>To give you some background, Greens n Beans began operations in March of 2022. But we've always been interested in making coffee drinks, even before we opened this caf√©. We even enrolled in a beginner's Barista class! We have an avid interest in creating various types of coffee drinks.</p>
                        
                        <p>But it has become a business! We found this very beautiful location and the first thing that popped into our mind was to build a <span class = "define">COFFEE SHOP</span>! Here we are, offering you an amazing place to unwind and enjoy the beach and its surrounding.</p>
